Garbage Collector - Python’s cleaner
It removes unused objects from memory automatically.
If no name (reference) points to an object.
That object is garbage - garbage means useless things.
Garbage Collector throws it away.

EXAMPLE:

>Box & Sticker Example (Best Way)
 ->Box = object (heap)
 ->Sticker = name (stack)
 ->No sticker on a box = garbage

x = 10
x = 20

--> Box 10 created
--> Sticker x points to 10
--> New box 20 created
--> Sticker x moves to 20
--> Box 10 has no sticker 
--> GC removes box 10
