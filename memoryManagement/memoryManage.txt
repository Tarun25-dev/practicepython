In pyhton, memory management is how python handles that data we given like code (variables,lists,tuples,etc,.)
Python’s job is to:
    1. Allocate memory when you create something
    2. Reuse memory when possible
    3. Free memory when objects are no longer needed
--> All of this is handled automatically by Python (you don’t manually allocate/free memory like in C).

Where Does Python Store Memory?
-> Python divides memory into two main areas:
   1. Stack memory
   2. Heap memory
1. Stack / namespace :
--> Stores function calls
--> Stores local variables
--> Very fast
--> Automatically cleared when a function ends

example:
x=10
y=20
print(x+y)

Here, x and y stored in stack and it doesnt conatins the values of 10,20 it only points the reference to 10 and 20 values that are in the heap memory
after print statement executed the python deletes those x and y variables in stack

2. Heap:
--> Stores objects (lists, dicts, class objects, etc.)
--> Managed by Python internally
--> Slower than stack but flexible

example:
x=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
d={"name":"tharun"}

--> List(X) and dictionary(d) are stored in heap
--> a and b are just references that reference stored on stack
