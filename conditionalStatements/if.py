#rules to follow the conditional statements
#1. Python does NOT require parentheses like java
#2. you must put a colon (:) after the condition.
#3. Everything inside if, elif, or else must be indented, usually 4 spaces.
#4. elif comes only after an if
#5. else must always be the last
#6. Conditions must return True/False
#7. Use logical operators for multiple conditions *and *or *not

#--> if statement
num=int(input("enter a nummber: "))
if num>0:
    print("given number is positive")
