#A list is an ordered collection of items.
#Items can be of any type: integers, strings, floats, or even other lists.
#Lists are mutable, which means you can change, add, or remove items.
#list is dynamic in size so it adjust the size automatically even though we remove or add elements easily
# creating a list
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "mango"]
mixed = [1, "apple", 3.5, True]

#creating an empty list
list=[]
print(numbers[4],fruits[2],mixed[3])
print(fruits[-1]) #-1 refers to the last element in list
print(fruits[-2]) #-2 refers to the last second element in list
