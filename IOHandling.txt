I/O Handling in python - how python reads data and writes data
> There are two types:
  1.console I/O
  2.File I/O

1. console input and output handling - how python handles  the input and output from the user 
    --> for input we use input() function
    --> for output display we use print() function
Example:
    name=input("enter your name")
    print(name)

2. File input and output handling - how python handles the files such as creating a file, reading a file, writing a file, etc.,
   --> for file handling python has a function called open(filename,mode)
   mode refers to the restrictions on file that we need to keep 
   such as,
   "r" --> for read purpose only and must file already exist
   "w" --> if there is a file then overwrites the matter otherwise it creates new file if not exists that file.
   "a" --> append mode which add info at last
   "r+" --> read + write purpose 
   "rb" --> read binary file(bin)
   "wb" --> write binary file(bin)
